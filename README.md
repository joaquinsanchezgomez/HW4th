# 4th Homework

### Team members:
Collin Rafferty, Lauren Done, Jennifer Lavayen, Hugo Pinto & Joaquin Sanchez Gomez


### Objective
In our group we decided to see which were
the determinants of the income of the oldest workers, of those 
between 50 and 65 years of age. 
We also wanted to see how important it is to distinguish by gender and ethnicity. 
As part of the exercise, we decided to analyze only the people who studied 
something related to business.

### Main findings
Opposite to the pattern that occurs with the entire labor force, in the case 
of older workers, the older they get, their income becomes lower. 
This makes sense. As older, people begin to retire and with it their income decreases. 
However, there are certain characteristics that unfortunately - in addition to age - 
determine that wages are lower, such as being a woman, being of African descent or Hispanic. 
The graphs show the regressions for both groups, according to gender.
